the test.py was my attempt to to figure out the Tempo. on the np.correlate i was looking into that and following advice on using it.
some said to use mode = "full" and some said to use mode "same", i went for "same" cause some adviced that full gets covariances for
extreme shifts, 1 array element overlaps seld, and based my code around it and some guidence from Durbin-Watson statistic which was
suggested as a refference.



for that formula that i mentioned, Tempo = F*60/lag, i was mistaken it was Tempo = Fs * 60 / lag

but i also was looking into:

and this was telling to use Tempo = 60 / log  , i've tried this but the output i was getting, felt wrong i didn't understand what im missing
